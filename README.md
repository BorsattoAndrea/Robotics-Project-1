# Robotics-Project-1
The code of the project for the course of Robotics at Politecnico di Milano
The scope of this project was to compute the odometry of a robot, given the speeds of the four motors, considering the robot as a skid steering robot and comparing the computed odometry with the real position of the robot (also given by the professor)
The project was devoleped using the middleware ROS and C++ as programming language.
The project has been done in groups of three students
